<h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

<p>
This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how Meddy, LLC and its related companies ("Company", "We", "Us") collect, use and share personal information of consumer users of the Meddy mobile application and website (www.adjacent.us) (collectively, the "Service"). This Policy also applies to any of our other websites that post this Policy.
<br>
This Policy does not apply to websites that post different statements.
</p>
<h3>WHAT WE COLLECT</h3>
<p>We get information about you in a range of ways. 
<br>
Information You Give Us. We collect your name, postal address, email address, phone number, fax number, username, password, demographic information (such as your gender and occupation) as well as other information you directly give us on our Service. In addition, we may collect and store any personal information you provide while using our Service or in some other manner.
<br>
This may include identifying information, such as your name, address, email address and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information. You may also provide us photos, a personal description and information for recommendations, such as search distance. If you chat with other Meddy users, you provide us the content of your chats, and if you contact us with a customer service or other inquiry, you provide us with the content of that communication.
<br>
Information We Get From Others. We may get information about you from other sources.  These other sources may include third party services, such as other social media sites, including but not limited to Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter.
<br>
Information Automatically Collected. We automatically log information about you and your computer. For example, when visiting our Service, we log your computer operating system type, browser type, browser language, the website you visited before browsing to our Service, pages you viewed, how long you spent on a page, access times and information about your use of and actions on our Service. This information could also include your device ID and type, your mobile device’s geographic location while our application is actively running, and the referring website address.
</p>
<b>Cookies.</b>
<p>
We may log information using "cookies." Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive by a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Service.
<br>
This type of information is collected to make the Service more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your activity on our Service, such as the pages you visit, the time and date of your visits and the links you click. If we advertise, we (or third parties) may use certain data collected on our Service to show you Meddy advertisements on other sites or applications.
</p>
<b>Pixel tags.</b>
<p>
We embed pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and emails. These tiny, invisible graphics are used to access cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed). We use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features and services. Ad companies also use pixel tags to measure the number of ads displayed and their performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad).
</p>
<b>Mobile Device IDs:</b>
<p>
If you're using our app, we use mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and later), instead of cookies, to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our app. Unlike cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted, but Advertising IDs can be reset in "Settings" on your iPhone. Ad companies also use device IDs or Advertising IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are more relevant to you. Analytics companies use device IDs to track information about app usage.
</p>
<b>Information Collected By Third-parties For Advertising Purposes.</b>
<p>
We may allow service providers, advertising companies and ad networks, and other third parties to display advertisements on our Service. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies or web beacons, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements.
