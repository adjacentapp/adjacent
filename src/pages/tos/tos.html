prohibited by applicable law, Virtual Items obtained by you are licensed 
to you, and you hereby acknowledge that no title or ownership in or 
to Virtual Items is being transferred or assigned hereunder. These Terms 
should not be construed as a sale of any rights in Virtual Items. Any 
Virtual Item balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world 
balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement 
of the extent of your license. Virtual Items do not incur fees for non-use; 
provided, however, that the license granted hereunder to Virtual Items 
will terminate in accordance with the terms and conditions of these 
Terms, when Meddy ceases providing the Service or these Terms or your 
Account is otherwise terminated. Meddy, in its sole discretion, reserves 
the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Virtual Items 
and/or may distribute Virtual Items with or without charge. You may 
purchase Virtual Items only within the Service or through a Software 
Store. Purchase and use of Virtual Items through a Software Store are 
subject to such Software Store’s governing documents, including but 
not limited to its terms of service and privacy policy. Meddy may manage, 
regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, with 
or without notice. Meddy shall have no liability to you or any third 
party in the event that Meddy exercises any such rights. The transfer 
of Virtual Items is prohibited, and you shall not sell, redeem or otherwise 
transfer Virtual Items to any person or entity. Virtual Items may only 
be redeemed through the Service. ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL 
ITEMS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. The provision 
of Virtual Items for use in the Service is a service provided by Meddy 
that commences immediately upon the acceptance of your purchase of such 
Virtual Items. You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred 
by you or anyone using your Meddy account. Meddy may revise the pricing 
for the goods and services offered through the Service at any time. 
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MEDDY IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY 
REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR 
UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE 
WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.</span></p>

Agreement.</span><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt">  All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive 
or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the 
Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that 
cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved 
by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this 
Arbitration Agreement.  Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings 
shall be held in English.  This Arbitration Agreement applies to you 
and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, 
predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized 
or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided 
under the Terms.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Notice Requirement and Informal 
Dispute Resolution</span><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt">.  Before either party may seek arbitration, the party 
must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (<span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold">“Notice”</span>) describing 
the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. 
 A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 540 Thompson Street, Ann 
Arbor, Michigan 48104.  After the Notice is received, you and the Company 
may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If you and the 
Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days 
after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration 
proceeding.  The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may 
not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined 
the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt">Arbitration Rules.  Arbitration shall be initiated 
through the American Arbitration Association (<span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold">“AAA”</span>), an established 
alternative dispute resolution provider (<span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold">“ADR Provider”</span>) that 
offers arbitration as set forth in this section.  If AAA is not available 
to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. 
 The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, 
including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding 
arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the 
Terms.  The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (<span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold">“Arbitration Rules”</span>) 
governing the arbitration are available online at </span><a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank"><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;color:#0000ff">www.adr.org</span></a><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt"> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitration 
shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes 
where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand 
U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based 
arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims or 
disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand 
U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be 
determined by the Arbitration Rules.  Any hearing will be held in a location 
within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the 
United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.  If you reside 
outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable 
notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment 
on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court 
of competent jurisdiction.  If the arbitrator grants you an award that 
is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you 
prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the 
greater of the award or $2,500.00.  Each party shall bear its own costs 
(including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration 
and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Additional Rules for Non-Appearance 
Based Arbitration</span><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt">.  If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, 
the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based 
solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by 
the party initiating the arbitration.  The arbitration shall not involve 
any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise 
agreed by the parties.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Time Limits.</span><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt">  If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration 
action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations 
(i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline 
imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Authority of Arbitrator</span><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt">.  If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will 
decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and 
the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined 
with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority 
to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator 
shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any 
non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable 
law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.  The arbitrator shall issue a written 
award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and 
conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of 
any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award 
relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. 
 The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Waiver of Jury Trial.</span><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt">  THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND 
STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE 
OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved 
by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.  Arbitration procedures 
are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules 
applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. 
 In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company 
in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration 
award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, 
instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Waiver of Class or Consolidated 
Actions</span><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt">.  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS 
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL 
BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER 
OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH 
THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Confidentiality</span><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt">.  All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including 
but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, 
shall be strictly confidential.  The parties agree to maintain confidentiality 
unless otherwise required by law.  This paragraph shall not prevent a 
party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to 
enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek 
injunctive or equitable relief.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Severability</span><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt">.  If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement 
are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of 
competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of 
no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement 
shall continue in full force and effect.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Right to Waive.</span><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt">  Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth 
in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom 
the claim is asserted.  Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other 
portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Survival of Agreement</span><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt">.  This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination 
of your relationship with Company.  </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Small Claims Court.</span><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt">  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the 
Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Emergency Equitable Relief</span><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt">.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may 
seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order 
to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.  A request for interim 
measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations 
under this Arbitration Agreement.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.

violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation 
of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets 
shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</span></p>
