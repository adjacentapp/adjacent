	<h5>Our Mission</h5>
  <p>
  We believe that start-ups are a key driver of positive change and innovation in the
  world. To create a better future for everyone, we have to ensure that all
  entrepreneurs have the resources they need to succeed.
  </p>
  <p>
  To move towards this vision we first need to challenge every assumption as to how
  start-ups are created and who can be a start-up founder. In turn, we need to design a
  system that provides every entrepreneur the resources and the community they
  need to succeed.
  </p>
  <p>
  When opportunity is equally distributed, the future becomes a little better for
  everyone because more people have a hand in creating it.
  </p>
  <p>
  Let’s get building.
  </p>

  <h5>Why Anonymity?</h5>
  <p>
  There’s few places where people’s ideas can come before their voice, their face, their
  educational pedigree and their social ties. This creates is a perpetual cycle where the
  people who look like they should be in a successful start-up are funded and
  mentored, which in turn makes them more likely to have a successful start-up.
  </p>
  <p>
  We specifically designed Adjacent’s interface so that the Founder of an idea is
  anonymous. When people chat and develop a sense of trust between each other,
  they can choose to share personal details.
  </p>
  <p>
  Everyone around you has an interesting idea in their head-- -sometimes we’re just so
  stuck seeing people as they are it’s hard to imagine where they can be.
